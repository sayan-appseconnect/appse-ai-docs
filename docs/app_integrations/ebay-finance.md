## Set Up Credential

:::note

Before you create a credential for EBay Finance using appse ai, ensure you have an [EBay Developer Account](https://developer.ebay.com/) and have created a Production application to obtain your API keys.

:::

### Required Fields

You'll be asked to fill in the following details:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Connection Name** | A label to identify this credential within appse ai. |
| **App ID (Client ID)** | The Client ID from your EBay Developer Portal Production keyset. |
| **Cert ID (Client Secret)** | The Client Secret from your EBay Developer Portal Production keyset. |
| **RuName (Redirect URL Name)** | The RuName generated after registering the appse ai callback URL in the EBay Developer Portal. |
| **Base API URL** | Select your environment: Production — `https://apiz.ebay.com/` or Sandbox — `https://apiz.sandbox.ebay.com/` |
| **Authorization URL** | Select your environment: Production — `https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize` or Sandbox — `https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize` |
| **Token URL** | Select your environment: Production — `https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token` or Sandbox — `https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token` |
| **API Access Scope** | Pre-filled with the required EBay Finances API scopes. |

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Open the Credential Form

Click **Select a Credential** and choose **EBay Finance** from the application list.

<img src="/img/credentials/ebay-finance/select-app.png" alt="appse ai EBay Finance Select Credential" width="700"/>

This opens the EBay Finance credential form. Enter your **Connection Name**.

---

#### 2. Get Your App ID and Cert ID

Navigate to the [EBay Developer Portal — Application Keys](https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys).

<img src="/img/credentials/ebay-finance/application-keys.png" alt="EBay Developer Portal Application Keys" width="700"/>

Under the **Production** keyset:

- Copy the **App ID (Client ID)** and paste it into the **App ID (Client ID)** field in appse ai.
- Copy the **Cert ID (Client Secret)** and paste it into the **Cert ID (Client Secret)** field in appse ai.

:::note
Use the **Production** keyset, not the Sandbox keyset, unless you are testing against the EBay Sandbox environment.
:::

On the same page, locate the **User Tokens** link next to your Client ID and click it to proceed to the next step.

---

#### 3. Get Your RuName (Redirect URL Name)

You should now be on the **User Tokens** page. If not, navigate directly to [EBay Developer Portal — User Tokens](https://developer.ebay.com/my/auth).

<img src="/img/credentials/ebay-finance/user-tokens-ru-name.png" alt="EBay Developer Portal User Tokens RuName" width="700"/>

1. Click **Get a Token from EBay via Your Application**.
2. In the **RuName** section, click **Add EBay Redirect URL**.
3. If this is your first time, EBay will display a **"Confirm the Legal Address for the Primary Contact or Business"** form before proceeding. Complete and submit this form to continue.
4. Once on the redirect URL registration screen, paste the appse ai callback URL into the **Your Auth accepted URL** field.
5. Click **Save**. EBay will generate a **RuName** — a unique identifier string (e.g., `YourAppName-YourApp-12345`), not a URL.
6. Copy this RuName identifier and paste it into the **RuName (Redirect URL Name)** field in appse ai.

:::note
The callback URL to register can be found in the appse ai credential form under the **RuName (Redirect URL Name)** field help text or your appse ai workspace settings.
:::

---

#### 4. Select Environment URLs

Select the appropriate URL for each field based on your target environment:

| Field | Production | Sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| **Base API URL** | `https://apiz.ebay.com/` | `https://apiz.sandbox.ebay.com/` |
| **Authorization URL** | `https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize` | `https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize` |
| **Token URL** | `https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token` | `https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token` |

:::note
Select **Production** URLs when connecting to your live EBay seller account. Use **Sandbox** URLs only for testing with EBay's Sandbox environment.
:::

---

#### 5. Authorize and Save

Once all fields are filled in, click **Save and Authorize** in appse ai.

<img src="/img/credentials/ebay-finance/credential-form.png" alt="appse ai EBay Finance Save and Authorize" width="700"/>

You will be redirected to EBay's OAuth authorization page. Log in with your EBay seller account and grant the requested permissions. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to appse ai.

<img src="/img/credentials/ebay-finance/save-credentials.png" alt="appse ai EBay Finance Credential Saved" width="700"/>

If successful, your EBay Finance credential will display a **✓** icon. You can now use EBay Finance in your workflows.

If it fails, a **!** icon will appear — recheck your App ID, Cert ID, and RuName, or contact support.

:::caution
Keep your Cert ID (Client Secret) secure. Do not share it publicly. Anyone with access to your credentials can interact with your EBay seller account.
