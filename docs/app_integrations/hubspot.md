**HubSpot CRM** is a cloud-based customer relationship management platform that helps businesses manage leads, track interactions, and grow customer relationships efficiently. It provides a unified space for sales, marketing, and support teams to collaborate and stay aligned.

  Apps installed through the HubSpot Marketplace use OAuth 2.0 authentication only. Marketplace users should install and connect the app directly through the OAuth flow and should not create a Private App or manually enter API keys, access tokens, client IDs, or client secrets.

## Set Up Credential

Before you can set up your HubSpot credential in **appse ai**, you need to have a **HubSpot Developer Account**.

### 1. Sign In / Create an account in HubSpot

Sign in or create a HubSpot account using your email address.  
 [https://app.hubspot.com/login](https://app.hubspot.com/login)

### 8. Scope
