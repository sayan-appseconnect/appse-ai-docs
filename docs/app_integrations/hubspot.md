**HubSpot CRM** is a cloud-based customer relationship management platform that helps businesses manage leads, track interactions, and grow customer relationships efficiently. It provides a unified space for sales, marketing, and support teams to collaborate and stay aligned.

## Set Up Credential

Before you can set up your HubSpot credential in **appse ai**, you need to have a **HubSpot Developer Account**.

This account gives you access to the **HubSpot Developer Dashboard**, where you can create and manage apps, generate the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, and configure authorization settings required for connecting HubSpot with appse ai.

### 1. Sign In / Create an account in HubSpot

Sign in or create a HubSpot account using your email address.  
 [https://app.hubspot.com/login](https://app.hubspot.com/login)
