Square POS is a point-of-sale platform that helps businesses manage in-person sales, payments, catalog items, customers, and store operations. With appse ai, you can connect your Square account to automate workflows that use Square business data and keep your sales, customer, and operational processes connected across systems.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open the Square Developer Dashboard

Log in to the [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps) with the Square account you want to connect.

### 2. Create or Open an Application

Pick the path that matches your Square Developer account: use an application you already have, or create a new one for appse ai.

For a live connection, use the application's **Production** credentials. For testing, switch to the **Sandbox** environment and use the sandbox credentials.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="open" label="Open existing application">

Use this path when you already have a Square application configured and only need to connect it to appse ai.

1. Navigate to the [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps) → **Applications** page.

2. Click on the open button for the respective application.

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP02.png" alt="Open existing application" width="700"/>

You will use this application’s OAuth settings and credentials in the following steps.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="new" label="Create new application">

Use this path when you need a new Square application for appse ai.

1. Navigate to the [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps) → **Applications** page

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP01.png" alt="Applications page" width="700"/>

2. Start creating an application by clicking on the Plus (+) icon displayed.

3. Enter an **Application name** you will recognize later.

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP07.png" alt="Enter app name" width="700"/>

4. Complete next steps - `What will you build first?`, `Find your audience` then finish creating the application.

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP08.png" alt="Choose product use case" width="700"/>

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP09.png" alt="Choose audience" width="700"/>

After the application is created, continue with **Configure OAuth** below.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Configure OAuth

In your Square application, go to the **OAuth** section and configure the redirect URL.

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP03.png" alt="Navigate to Oauth" width="700"/>

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP04.png" alt="Configure redirect URL" width="700"/>

Add the callback URL displayed in the appse ai configure credential form. For example:

```text
https://embedded-ui.appse.ai/oauth-callback.html
```

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP05.png" alt="Redirect URL popup" width="700"/>

This URL must match the **Callback URL** shown in the appse ai Square POS credential form.

### 4. Copy Application Credentials

From the Square application's OAuth settings, copy the following values:

- **Application ID**
- **Application Secret**

<img src="/img/credentials/square-pos/SP10.png" alt="Application credentials" width="700"/>

Keep the Application Secret secure and do not share it publicly.

### 5. Add the Credential in appse ai

In appse ai, open the Square POS credential form and enter the required details:

1. Add a **Connection Name**.
2. Select the **Authorization URL** for Production or Sandbox.
3. Select the matching **Token URL**.
4. Select the matching **Base API URL**.
5. Paste the **Application ID**.
6. Paste the **Application Secret**.
7. Review or update the **OAuth Scopes**.
8. Confirm the **Callback URL** matches the URL configured in Square.

- Click **Save & Authorize**. appse ai will redirect you to the Square sign-in page.
- Sign in with your Square credentials, review the permission request, and click **Allow** to approve access.
- After approval, you will be redirected back to appse ai. Confirm that the Square credential is validated successfully and ready to use.
